**Project Description**
Visual Studio extension for integrating MetaEdit+ and Visual Studio. This extension allows you to browse MetaEdit+ models and use the main MetaEdit+ functions from Visual Studio. It can also automatically import into Visual Studio the source code generated from MetaEdit+. 

The integration between MetaEdit+ models and Visual Studio includes:

* One-click access to your {"MetaEdit+"} repository from Visual Studio
* Live tree view in Visual Studio of all your {"MetaEdit+"} models
* Double-click to open and edit {"MetaEdit+"} models from Visual Studio
* Autobuild: generate code from MetaEdit+ models, import into a Visual Studio solution, build and run
* Trace and debug on both the code and model levels simultaneously
Watch a [video (5min)](http://www.metacase.com/webcasts/IntegratingVisualStudioAndMetaEdit.html) demonstrating the use of the MetaEdit+ extension for Visual Studio. 

See [installation instructions](docs/InstallingInstructions.md), [getting started](docs/GettingStarted.md) and the [plugin guide](docs/AdvancedInstructions.md) for details. See the [plugin guide for developers](docs/ExtendingThePluginGuide.md) and the [source code](https://github.com/MetaCase/metaedit-extension-for-visual-studio/tree/master/GraphBrowser/trunk) for extending the plugin further.
