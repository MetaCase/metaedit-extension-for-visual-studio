# Install Visual Studio 2010

The extension is made for Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate and Professional editions. If you don't have either of these, you may download and install the Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate trial version from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/fi-fi/products/2010-editions/ultimate).
