# Install Visual Studio

The extension is made for Visual Studio versions supporting extensions (2012 Ultimate and Professional editions, or 2013 or later Community or Express Editions). If you don't have a compatible Visual Studio version installed, you may download and install the Visual Studio Community edition from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

**Note: if you want to open and modify the Graph Browser extension, rather than just use it, you may also need to install the Visual Studio SDK (or in 2017: Workloads | Other Toolsets | Visual Studio Extension Development) in addition to your Visual Studio installation. Please check your Visual Studio version and install the appropriate components.**
