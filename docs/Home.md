**Project Description**
Visual Studio extension for integrating MetaEdit+ and Visual Studio. This extension allows you to browse MetaEdit+ models and use the main MetaEdit+ functions from Visual Studio. It can also automatically import into Visual Studio the source code generated from MetaEdit+. 

The integration between MetaEdit+ models and Visual Studio includes:

* One-click access to your {"MetaEdit+"} repository from Visual Studio
* Live tree view in Visual Studio of all your {"MetaEdit+"} models
* Double-click to open and edit {"MetaEdit+"} models from Visual Studio
* Autobuild: generate code from MetaEdit+ models, import into a Visual Studio solution, build and run
* Trace and debug on both the code and model levels simultaneously
Watch a [video (5min)](http://www.metacase.com/webcasts/IntegratingVisualStudioAndMetaEdit.html) demonstrating the use of the MetaEdit+ extension for Visual Studio.
